My very first assignment during Computer Science Fundamentals I coursework at Western University.

# Assignment 1-A
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each successive number in the sequence is obtained by adding the two previous numbers in the sequence. The sequence is named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci da Pisa. The sequence starts with zero and one, and proceeds forth as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 and so on. The Fibonacci sequence is widely used in applications pertaining to mathematics, science, computers, art and nature.

This sequence will continue up to and including the value entered by a user prompt. This prompt will be included in the student’s program for this part.
The output must look exactly as shown. Each separate line will consist of the sequence number followed by a colon, one space and then the next value in the sequence outputted as an unformatted value. This will be followed by a single space and the same value formatted with commas.

# Assignment 1-B
Create a program to find all prime numbers within a user specified range.

Upon execution of this portion of the program, the user will be asked to provide the from & to range and then the program would display all the prime numbers in sequential manner for the provided range. Using this program, the user can find out the prime numbers between any valid range. The user enters the desired range, for example, if the user wants to display all the prime numbers from 100 to 999 then they will enter numbers 100 and 999 when program prompts for input.

# Assignment 1-C
Moore’s Law concerns the rate of increase in computer performance.

Gordon E. Moore first made his observation back in the relatively early days of mass produced computers. In crude terms, it describes how much computing power you can stuff into a given volume.

Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years.

Project One – Part C will compute and display a crude estimate of this law and the resulting computing power this represents.

One measure of computing power if the number of Floating-Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS) a computer is capable of preforming. For the purpose of this assignment, assume that each transistor results in 50 FLOPS (this is not technically accurate, but it does allow a good representation of the increase in computing power over the years).

If a computer had 100 transistors, it would be assumed (for the purpose of this program) to be capable of 5,000 FLOPS (100 * 50).

The program will prompt a user for three values.
The starting number of transistors:
The year to start the calculations from:
The number of years to calculate.

As Moore’s law states the increase is based on a two year cycle. Compute the increase in two year increments. Each two year cycle will produce twice as many transistors as the previous two year cycle.

The computing power (FLOPS) is simply the number of transistors multiplied by a factor of 50.

The output will show the year, the number of transistors and then the computing power in FLOPS (first as a Unit Definition to two (02) decimal places and then as the actual number).

NOTE:
The unit definition will reflect the actual values.
so:
40,000 FLOPS is 40 KiloFLOPS
and
40,000,000 FLOPS is 40 MegaFLOPS
